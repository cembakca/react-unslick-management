# react-unslick-management

## Why?
In a project I used React Slick. But react slick component's unslick method doesn't  work. So, i want to solve it.
This solution seems like very bad. But it can be used temporarily.

## What exactly is he doing?

The slider could be activated or deactivated depending on the state of the screen size. You can only manage it with the prop
